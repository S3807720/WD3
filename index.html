                        We are the Australian Crypto Regulatory Committee. Our role is to educate the public about the taxation rules, history and risks in investing in cryptocurrencies. We are also involved in lobbying activities to help change regulations and rules regarding
                        cryptocurrencies for the better.

                        Cryptocurrency or crypto is a digital asset that is designed to work as a medium of exchange where individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in the form of a digital database using strong cryptography to keep these records safe
                        and support the creation and verification of new coins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized, meaning there is no single company that controls it, and therefore they are susceptible to malicious attacks and can also facilitate illegal activities. The taxation for these currencies can be complicated
                        and many investors unknowingly fail to declare, and can be up for fines or worse from the ATO.

                    <img class="btc right" src="images/btc.png" alt="bitcoin coin"> A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies
                    are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering
                    them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The word “cryptocurrency” is derived from the encryption techniques which are used to secure the network.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Blockchains, which are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data, are an essential component of many cryptocurrencies.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Many experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries, including finance and law.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cryptocurrencies face criticism for a number of reasons, including their use for illegal activities, exchange rate volatility, and vulnerabilities of the infrastructure underlying them. However, they also have been praised for their portability, divisibility,
                            inflation resistance, and transparency.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <sl-tab-panel name="Risks">
                    <p>
                        The risks of trading cryptocurrencies are mainly related to its volatility. They are high-risk and speculative, and it is important that you understand the risks before you start trading. They are volatile: unexpected changes in market sentiment can lead
                        to sharp and sudden moves in price. It is not uncommon for the value of cryptocurrencies to quickly drop by hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are unregulated: As a decentralised currency, cryptocurrencies are currently unregulated by both governments and central banks. They were developed to be free from government oversight or influence and are instead monitored by peer-to-peer internet
                        protocol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are susceptible to error and hacking: as a digital currency, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to technical glitches, human error or hacking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They can be affected by forks or discontinuation: cryptocurrency trading carries additional risks such as hard forks or discontinuation. When a hard fork occurs, there may be substantial price volatility around the event, and we may suspend trading throughout
                        if we do not have reliable prices from the underlying market.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you’re looking to buy cryptocurrency, you will need an online app called a “wallet” to hold your currency. Most cryptocurrency exchanges allow you to create an account, then transfer fiat currency (such as Australian Dollars) to buy cryptocurrencies
                        such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. A growing number of cryptocurrency trading exchanges allow you to create a wallet to store your cryptocurrency, as well as buy and sell on the exchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, if you’re new to the crypto space and feeling a little overwhelmed, don’t fret. Crypto can seem complicated and daunting at first but in reality, understanding how exchanges work and the core ideas behind what you’re investing in takes a bit of leg
                        work and research before you dive in. To help you get started, here’s a 5-step guide to buying cryptocurrency. Every person has their own preferences and trading goals which will dictate which exchange they should choose. Some
                        people want the widest selection of coins, while others are looking for Australian-based and personalised customer support, some want all the advanced trading features while some are just after the easiest way to buy crypto and
                        let their investment grow. When choosing an exchange, the main things you should keep in mind are:
                    </p>

                    In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of “b-money”, an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo created “bit gold”. Like bitcoin and other currencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later
                    gold-based exchange, BitGold) was an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system based on a reusable proof
                    of work was later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai and Szabo.

                    In February 2014, cryptocurrency made national headlines due to the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, declaring bankruptcy. The company stated that it had lost nearly $473 million of their customer’s bitcoins likely due to theft. This was equivalent
                    to approximately 750,000 bitcoins, or about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. Due to this crisis, among other news, the price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February.

            <h2>Tax</h2>
            <p>
                First and foremost, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) does not view cryptocurrency as money, either Australian Dollar or any fiat currency. Instead, it is viewed as ‘property,’ a CGT asset for tax purposes. The definition from the official ATO website further
                goes on to say: “The term cryptocurrency is generally used to describe a digital asset in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of additional units and verify transactions on a blockchain. Cryptocurrency generally
                operates independently of a central bank, central authority or government.” When a capital gain or loss is made from cryptocurrency, the market value of the cryptocurrency in Australian Dollars at the time of disposal is used to calculate
                it.
            </p>
            <h4>Are you an investor, or a trader?</h4>
            <p>
                Understanding whether you are categorised as a cryptocurrency investor or trader in tax is crucial to understanding your crypto tax obligations, as investors are most commonly subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), while traders are typically carrying on
                a business or profit-making activity that derives Ordinary Income.
            </p>
            <h4>Investor</h4>
            <p>
                Despite the name, and the fact you may regularly ‘trade’ cryptocurrencies, most Australians will fall under the Investor category. If your dealings with cryptocurrency predominantly involve using it as a personal investment, and the majority of your earnings
                are coming from long-term gains, you will likely fall under this Investor category. In this instance, gains and losses on cryptocurrency are subject to Capital Gains Tax, or CGT.
            </p>

            <h4>Trader</h4>

                Traders are businesses, including sole traders, that operate a business that involves cryptocurrency. To be classified as a trader, you must assess your facts and circumstances and consider how the Australian Taxation Office will view the activity. At
                minimum you should be: Carrying on your activity for commercial reasons and in a commercially viable way Undertaking activities in a business-like manner – e.g preparing business plans, acquiring capital assets or inventory in line with
                the business plan Preparing accounting records and marketing your business name These are only some of the factors that go into determining what is considered a business activity. There can be a number of other important factors, such
                as your professional education, hours spent on the activity, sophistication and scale of the activity, use of automation and many others. Tax treatment is not a matter of choice but is based on an objective assessment of the relevant facts
                and circumstances. A single activity can only have one tax treatment, though it is possible to have more than one activity; with one being an investment activity and the other being a business activity. Disputes on the nature of income
                in mixed portfolios are common, so it is important to clearly separate and document each activity. If you’re unsure on your self-assessment of the situation, it is best to check with a tax agent who specialises in cryptocurrency.
            </p>
            <h4>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) </h4>
            <p>
                As previously mentioned, the ATO classifies digital currency as a CGT asset, similar to a share in a company. It is therefore required to assess your capital gains each time you trade, sell or gift your crypto assets or have any other type of disposal
                event. There are several types of capital gains events, and we’ll discuss these in the section below.
            </p>
            <h4>Capital gains</h4>

            <p>
                If you own any type of asset and you make a profit after you sell, trade or gift that asset, then you’ll need to pay tax on the capital gain you’ve made.
